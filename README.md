OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT: PREDECTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this task is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The goal is to split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Additionally, you will visualize the regression line and actual versus predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.


KEY ACTIVITIES:

1.Prepare Data

2.Split Data (into training and testing sets)

3.Train Model (using linear regression)

4.Evaluate Model (using metrics like MSE and R-squared)

5.Visualize Results (using plots)

6.Interpret Model (understand the results and make decisions)


TECHNOLOGIES USED:

1.Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

2.NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.

3.Scikit-learn: For machine learning, including linear regression models and evaluation metrics.

4.Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and linear regression analysis.

5.Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

6.Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, built on top of Matplotlib.

KEY INSIGHTS:

1.Understanding the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

2.Measuring the model's accuracy and performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.

3.Identifying any outliers or anomalies in the data.

4.Evaluating the assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.

5.Making predictions based on the model and using it for decision making.

6.Identifying areas for improvement and further exploration.
